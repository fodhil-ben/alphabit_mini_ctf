you were given this decrypted flag and told that the new GPS is "UHQKRNWLFIYJBTODCZVAXEGSMP"
so the new gps means that this letters are the substitution alphabit used to encrypt the flag 
you need to know that the method used is the substitution cipher 

the flag is :

Alphabit{Subst1tut10n_1s_n0t_c0mpl1c4t3d}
